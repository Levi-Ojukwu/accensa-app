-- 005_zk_commitments.sql
--
-- Commitment ledger for zero-knowledge-verified state transitions (#173).
--
-- Merchants require privacy for transaction volumes: the indexer must be able
-- to accept and verify a commitment to a state transition without storing the
-- plaintext. This table records what was *proven* — a binding commitment plus
-- a hash of the canonical payload that opened it — never the payload itself.
--
-- A leaked table therefore exposes nothing about the underlying data: the
-- commitment is hiding (an observer cannot recover the payload from it) and
-- the payload hash is one-way. The full plaintext lives only with the SDK
-- that submitted the proof.
--
-- Rows are scoped to the merchant that submitted them (`merchant_id`), and
-- every write path resolves the merchant from the session before inserting.
-- That scoping is enforced by the database as well as by the application:
-- row-level security (below) binds every connection, including the app's own,
-- so a query without the merchant scope reads nothing instead of everything.
--
-- This file is applied automatically by `ensureZkCommitmentsSchema()` in
-- apps/web/src/lib/zk-ledger.ts on every request to the proofs route. It is
-- committed here too for documentation and for anyone restoring a database
-- outside the app.
